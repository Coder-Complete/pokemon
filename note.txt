- api practice
  - x - pokemon website
    - x - explain query parameters and endpoints
    - x - pagination - continuous scroll of pokemon
  - refactor pokemon w/ async/await
  - jsontypicode website - twitter
    - first explain why this api is nice - basically acts as a mock db
    - then teach the new http methods
    - first see feed
    - when click user, window slides out from right w/ user's tweets
    - then mention caching - so don't need to keep requesting tweets from same user, and maybe set a timer to clear the cache and fetch again if same user is clicked
- pass data across pages
  - url params
  - localstorage / sessionstorage
    - maybe do cart for shopping cart site?
- array methods (map, filter, reduce?, indexOf, findIndex, find?, forEach?)
